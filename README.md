# How to properly use the Display Banner system
In this short guide I'll explain the proecss of uploading ad taking proper care of the dispaly banner's web visualization.

The platforms used will be:

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) (to create the banners)
- [Bannerify](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/796124491692147799/Bannerify-Banner-Studio) (plugin for Figma, to export the banners)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) (to host the site)
- [GitHub](https://github.com) (to host the banners themself)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (to upload the banners on the server)
- Excel (with a specific file to generate the links for the banners)
- [Brackets](https://brackets.io) (or any html editor to ad the new links)

# Exporting from Bannerify
Export the .zip file from Figma using these settings:

> *Note: for the moment the .webp image format is not supported by the dev team and the file size may very.*

# Naming the file
Once the .zip file has been exported from Bannerify, needs to be named. Here is important to keep a good consistency.
